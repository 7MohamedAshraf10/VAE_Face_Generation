# VAE_Face_Generation
## The following is the main part of the assignment:
- Train a VAE to fit data onto 4-10 distributions (choose 1 of the values in that range) which is 
the setting of distributionâ€™s vector length (for example 6 means 6 * (Mean, Std [sigma]).

- Generate a few images by sampling from the distribution and decoding. Apply the model on 
test images.

## Dataset
- Dataset consists of 250 custom images. all images 
are gathered
- Image size between 64 and 128.
